## Data sources

Data for this exercise has been collected through two different sources:

- % of smokers per country: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/433390/individuals-who-currentl
- GDP per capita: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita)
- % of religious population per country: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religions_by_country)
- Latitude/Longitude of European countries: [Google Public data](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv)

The three sources have been merged in a single dataset as follows.

## Summary of the dataset

After merging the data sources, the resulting dataset is:

```{r}
    data_raw<-read.csv("data.csv",sep=";", encoding = "UTF-8")
    names(data_raw)[1]<-"country"
    str(data_raw)
```

## The tool

The tool allows the following features:

- Select which predictors must be used in the analysis (multiple selection)
- Normalization of the data
- 3 different models can be fitted to the data: a lineal model, a tree model and a random forest model. A summary of each model is shown (optional).
- Each predictor is plotted against the explained variable (%smokers) with the possibility of drawing an indivdual lineal model for each plot.
- A map is also shown (optional) with each country and the% of smokers. 

## Example

An example of the plots presented by the tool

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

p1<-qplot(
  x=data_raw$lat,
  y=data_raw$smokers,
  xlab="Latitude",
  ylab="% Smokers"
) + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=T)

p2<-qplot(
  x=data_raw$lng,
  y=data_raw$smokers,
  xlab="Longitude",
  ylab="% Smokers"
) + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=T)

p3<-qplot(
  x=data_raw$gdp_capita,
  y=data_raw$smokers,
  xlab="GDP epr capita",
  ylab="% Smokers"
) + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=T)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3,nrow = 1)
          
```
